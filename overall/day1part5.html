		<h2>Start building a single page application (day 1, part 5)</h2>
		<h3>Let's start building</h3>
		In this course we promised to build an application. So let's do as promised.
		We will re-use some of the excercises we already made.
		
		What are the usecases of demo application:
		<ul>
			<li>Present a multimedia presentation.</li>
			<li>Upload multimedia items.</li>
			<li>Add and delete multimedia items to a presentation</li>
			<li>Determine the position, height and width of videos and pictures in a presentation</li>
			<li>Determine length in time and loudness of sounds and videos in a presentation</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
		There are a few terms used previously that need some definition:
		<ul>
			<li>Mulltimedia items are sounds, videos and or picures/images</li>
		</ul>
		Lets start with making a extreemly simple presentation. But of course we start thinking about the requirements and therefore tests.
		The first presentation display 3 different pictures in a timely fashion
		Let's say that the presentation is represented by
		
		<pre class="brush: javascript;">
		{
			name: 'first presentation',
			display: [
			{ time: ["0:01","0:25"],
				url: "http:\\....."
			}, 
			{ time: ["0:28","0:45"],
				url: "http:\\....."
			}, 
			{ time: ["0:46","1:05"],
				url: "http:\\....."
			}, 
			]
		}
		</pre>
		<p>
		Excercise: describe a time based test
		</p>
		<p>
		Excercise: use a Timer function to show the different items. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Excercise: add an argument to the previous list, which describes the type of mediapresentation
		</p>
		<p>
		Excercise: show the mediapresentation.
		</p>
		<h3>Single page application</h3>
		<p>
		The previous excercises don't feel like a application. It had almost no interaction it its user-interface it just displays the presentation. So let's start with a starting screen.
		</p>
		<p>
		Excercise: make a start screen with two options: "run presentation once" and "run presentation continously"
		</p>
