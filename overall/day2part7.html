	<h2>GEO TODO</h2>
	TODO http://leafletjs.com/
	geoallocation/mapping things see also all things RWS
	And see the dir
	For colors see http://colorbrewer2.org/

	<h2>DEVICE ORIENTATION</h2>
	<b>TODO</b> see also http://www.sitepoint.com/using-device-orientation-html5/?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email
	
	<h2>SVG TODO</h2>
	Some other parts that needs some place, also mention RaphaelJS (<a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">http://raphaeljs.com/</a>, maybe incl book and maybe also alternatives, at least link to processing.org TODO also mentions snap.svg (see explaining video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeLOt_BRAqc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeLOt_BRAqc</a>) http://www.farinspace.com/top-svg-javascript-libraries-worth-looking-at/)
	
	ALso link to Raphael book
	
	Advantages of using RaphaelJS
	Under the hood, as they say, Raphael uses a format known as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), the browser’s built-in graphics language. For older versions of Internet Explorer that do not speak SVG, it “falls back” on a similar format known as Vector Markup Language (VML). By contrast, popular visualization tools like D3JS and ProcessingJS do not work on older browsers. At the time of this writing, just under 15% of users worldwide have a version of Internet Explorer earlier than IE9, meaning they would see a blank screen if you use one of those tools. That number will be higher or lower depending on the demographics of your audience, and it will continue to recede worldwide each year, but the added compatibility is a nice check mark in Raphael’s column.
	
	Different use-case for D3.js verus Raphael.js
	Raphael is also considerably easier to learn. At work, I use D3 for projects that specifically call for it, and Raphael for everything else. (D3 also does not work on Internet Explorer 8 and below, unlike Raphael. Learning Raphael will also give you a keen familiarity with the standard properties of SVG objects, which will come in handy if you decide to give D3 a try later on.
	<p>
		There are two elements that accoording to 'the' defintion is are not part of html5 but are always named in coherence with html5. The first one is Scalable Vector Graphics, shortend to SVG. The specification is defined at <a href"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/</a>. An simple example is shown beneath:
	</p>
	<pre class="brush: javascript;">		
	 <svg style="width:100px; height:100px;"><circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="green"/></svg></pre>
	<p>
		Which results in the following output
	</p>
	 <svg style="width:100px; height:100px;"><circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="green"/></svg>
	<h2>MATH TODO</h2>
	 <p>
	 The other one accoording to the specs is math element. But it is currently not directly supported (anymore). See <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/mathml-forges-on.html">http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/mathml-forges-on.html</a> for more details.
 </p>
	<h2>VIDEO TODO</h2>
	Showed be part before streaming the camera input, just as a small introductory paragraph
 Another important new element is the video element which we already used in previous to connect to our camera:
	<pre class="brush: javascript;">		
	 <video src="images/small.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls></video></pre>
	<p>
 <video src="images/small.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls></video>
 <p>
 A more comprehesive list of all difference can be found at <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/">www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/</a>

	<h2>WebGL webgl</h2>
