		<h2>What is HTML5 (day 2, part 1)</h2>
		<p>
			HTML5 is browser driven change on the HTML specification. In reality this means features are developed by browser vendors (and community developers) which end up to become standardized and formalized in a later stage (or not). Therefore there was no clear specification on what is part of HTML5 on what is not for a long time. There was however a growing concessus of things that are clearly seen as part of it and what is not. Next to that there is a continuous different opinion between vendor browsers resulting in different implementations.

			A long list of the differences can be found at <a href="http://caniuse.com/">http://caniuse.com/</a>. A recent blog post about the status of the html5 standardization proces state can be found at

			The W3C organization categorized the different changes that are (or beter can become) part of the HTML5 spec are: 
			<ul>
				<li>semantics</li>
				<li>css3</li>
				<li>multimedia</li>
				<li>graphics and 3D</li>
				<li>device access</li>
				<li>performance</li>
				<li>offline storage</li>
				<li>connectivity</li>
			</ul>
		<p>As the title of this second part of this course already suggested HTML is not one specification or API or library. It is a wild west. In a nice graphical overview on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#New_APIs">wikipedia</a> helps in getting some overall view on this, although far not as up-to-date as the <a href="http://caniuse.com/">http://caniuse.com/</a> site.</p>
