		JQuery less usage due to selectors.
		
		
		<h3>Mobile first</h3>

		Home page and navigation:
		Keep call to action front and center
		Logo is home
		Menu short and sweet no scrolling should be necessary

		Search should be visible
		Smart search (completing, spelling correction result, context aware search (not just google))
		Never zero in the result list (should be clear while searching)
		Select instead of navigate (in case this can be done in view select questions)

		Let user 
		Purchase as guest
		Don't ask personal information up front
		Picking up where left off (consistent url policy)

		Design efficient form (it is already painfull enough)
		Auto filling form
		Use pre existing 
		Minimize tabs and handling
		Real-time validation

		Side wide considerations
		Don't make users pinch and zoom
		Provide expandable / tabble images
		Be clear in why you need your users location
		Keep browser in your single browser window
		Don't let promotions steal the show
		Optimize your entire site for mobile
