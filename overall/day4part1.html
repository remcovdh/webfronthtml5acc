		<h2>..... (day 4, part 1)</h2>
		<h3>History and aspects of javascript libraries / frameworks</h3>
		<p>
		Javascript has come a long way. It started out as being just a tool for some interactive snippets in the browser. Currently it is a full programming environment which in some cases stretches from being in control of the total client but even server side it can be used and replace all your other code (although you maybe not want that, but for an example see the MEAN stack). 
		</p>
		<p>
			With the upcome of Ajax, a different non fully page based interfaces could occur and there was a way to make more dynamic interfaces. Thus, JavaScript libraries such as Prototype, script.aculo.us, jQuery and JavaScript widget libraries such as Ext JS, DHTMLX, and Dojo Toolkit were developed. These libraries were partly focused on cross browser issues and the capabilities that came with Ajax, by solving that problem for you it was easier to get more productive. Most of these libraries and frameworks are still heavily used these days, and there are certainly use-cases in which they are a good solution any the do not make a set of problems related to developing SPA's any easier.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is only recently that we changed from a page based request model with Ajax elements towards a full single page application that intergrates on a data level with it's server. The libraries and frameworks that will be discussed here are focussing mostly on making these single page application possible mainly by having a full client side MVC (or as some say MV-whatever frameworks). These SPA's have their on model, mostly there views exist in the browser. The tools, framework and libraries enhance and speedup the developement process for Single page applications.
