		<h3>Style, design. It is such a wide topic</h3>
		<p>
		This course is focussed on accelaration, front-end and html5. A well designed page will get the user more quickly to the content they want. We also will certainly look into what is happening from a front-end developer point of view and what are the new capabilities of HTML5. We do however do not have an opinion on all kind of different styles and design. This certainly is not a design course.
	</p>
	<p>
		And for who, whom and what are we designing? Is it the 68 inch wide TV screen, the mobile phone of 4,5 inch or is it the desktop computer. All these example will have different sizes, number of pixels, interaction model, common usage etc etc. So next to the type of browser which will in some cases also be very restricted the so called form factor is an important parameter to decide on the best design solution or if needed different design solution for different use-cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the consumer market is currently shifting from a traditional desktop user to a mobile user. There is a tendency to work mobile first because of the larger restrictions on the mobile user.
