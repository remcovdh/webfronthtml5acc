		<h2>The frameworks and architecture (day 4, part 3)</h2>
		<h3>Modern javascript frameworks</h3>
		<h4>Backbone</h4>
		<p>
			Backbone.js is a lightweight MVC framework. Born in 2010, it quickly grew popular as a lean alternative to heavy, full-featured MVC frameworks such as ExtJS. This resulted in many services adopting it, including Pinterest, Flixster, AirBNB and others. Provides REST-persistable models with simple routing and callbacks so you know when to render views (you supply your own view-rendering mechanism).
	</p>
	<p>
			As being a rather lean soltuion a lot of extensions are made to get into a more fully fletched framework. Marionette being one of the most well known ones. 
	</p>
		
		<h4>Knockout</h4>
			<p>
				Aims to simplify JavaScript UIs by applying the Model-View-View Model (MVVM) pattern. Tightly focused on rich UIs: DOM-based templates with declarative bindings, and observable models with automatic dependency detection. Clearly resonating in the  Microsoft community. A comparison is made over <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/11/22/backbone-vs-knockout/"> here</a>
			</p>
		
		<h4>Angular</h4>
		AngularJS was born in 2009 as a part of a larger commercial product, called GetAngular. Shortly after, Misko Hevery, one of the engineers who founded GetAngular, managed to recreate a web application that consisted of 17 thousand lines of code and took 6 months to develop in a mere 3 weeks using just GetAngular. Reducing the size of the application to just about 1,000 lines of code convinced Google to start sponsoring the project, turning it into the open-source AngularJS we know today. Amongst Angular’s unique and innovative features are two-way data bindings, dependency injection, easy-to-test code and extending the HTML dialect by using directives.

		<h4>Ember</h4>
		Ember’s roots go way back to 2007. Starting its life as the SproutCore MVC framework, originally developed by SproutIt and later by Apple, it was forked in 2011 by Yehuda Katz, a core contributor to the popular jQuery and Ruby on Rails projects. Notable Ember users include Yahoo!, Groupon, and ZenDesk.

		<h4>Durandal</h4>
		To see an overview of some of the capabilities and differences between Durandal and Angular look into how the ideas of these two frameworks are converging into one. See <a href="http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/angular-and-durandal-converge/"> announcement</a>
		
		<h4>React</h4>
		React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time. A good explanation if the key reasons how React differs from other frameworks like angular can be found http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html.

		<h3>Futural frameworks</h3>
		Two very interesting frameworks:
		<ol>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> Which is an so called isometric framework. For a more futher explantion <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/08/the-future-of-web-apps-is-ready-isomorphic-javascript/">see.</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Webcomponents</a> and googles implementation of webcomponents called 
				<a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">polymer</a>
			</li>
		</ol>
