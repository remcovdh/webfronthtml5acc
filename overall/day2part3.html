		<h2>Communication between client and server (day 2, part 3)</h2>
		
		<h3>In the beginning</h3>
		<p>
			Classicaly all communication on the web was page based. Although these pages were using different files, a file for structure, files with images, a file with style and sometimes a separate files with client side dynamics (javascript). In the browser every server request resulted in a full page re-render. This resulted in long waiting times and a blocking / freezing screens when pages became bigger. Some of it could be well handled by the chaching. 
		<h3>Caching</h3>
		<b>TODO CACHING</b>. Cache-Control HTTP Headers HTTP 1.1 
		<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/caching">
		https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/caching</a>
		It is important to specify one of Expires or Cache-Control max-age, and one of Last-Modified or ETag, for all cacheable resources. It is redundant to specify both Expires and Cache-Control: max-age, or to specify both Last-Modified and ETag. 
		An example
		But Due to the dynamic nature of web 2.0 websites, it is difficult to use static web caching. The reason for this is that dynamic websites -per definition- have personalized content for different users and/or regions.
		<h2>Ajax</h2>
		It was later also partly solved by using Ajax. Ajax made refreshing a part of the screen possible. In the beginning most of the ajax requested content were views. Nowadays there is also a strong movement towards a data interface instead of a views interface between browser and server. In this way you could already build a single page web application (SPA). In a SPA you do not request new pages. All the information needed to build further information can be either build from the first full page request or being requested by ajax calls. This model can be made two work but as you possibly quickly find that you soon want more. In this model all the information and updates needs to be requested by the browser. Nothing can be stored over two different sessions in de browser. But like always the best solution depends on a set of different parameters: the use-case of the solution, the budget, the experience off the development and maintenaince team, time-to-market etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		But lets make a minimal set up to work. A canonical example (the hello world of javascript frameworks) can be found at <a href="toodo">todo</a>What if we need to build this with only ajax and a minimal set of rest based interfaces.
	</p>
	
	<div class='excercise'>
		<br/>
		<b>Excercises:</b><br />
		<ol>
			<li>Use an ajax based request in which a list is fetched and presented only after the button is pressed</li>
			<li>Use an ajax based request in which a list is fetched before the button is pressed</li>
		</ol>
		<br />
		<br />
		
	</div>
	<br />
	<p class='excercise'>

		<b>Sharing results</b><br/>

	<h3>Compression</h3>
	You can compress and sent compressed files over the line. This can be done in several ways. A few we will dive into deeper in later lessons. <b>TODO</b>http version to do this. 
	<h3>Websockets</h3>
