		<h2>..... (day 3, part 1)</h2>
		<h3>Designed course application</h3>
		<p>
			There seem to be very different use-cases for mobile phone, tablet info and desktop learning. In the case of:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The mobile phone, the main reasons why somebody looks on our site: interset in course and want tour/ check content on specifics or want to subscribe to a course. Videos are linked to but will not be standard started and only on demand.
			</li>
			<li>
				On the tablet it can be all use-case described above, but it will also include learning by consuming info. Making code and/or adjust code files is not part of this use-case. Making smaller test with short questions/answer without too much typing is.
			</li>
			<li>
				The desktop contain possibly all information can link directly to runable solution and maybe even virtual machines.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Usergroup are developers (nerd like people). The want to do the new thing and be cool but are sometimes restricted by technology paradigms they are used to. The mainly beta type people who like exact solutions. These people will have a very wide range of different devices from very heavy desktop with multiple screens, old machines which we can hardly remember, newest smartphone rooted with neweset alpha software installed and old-fashioned nokia, tablets in all forms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keywords: fun, new, together, improve, beauty
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fun: unexpected, happy (color, rounded, fluffy)</li>
			<li>New: the news, OLD-NEW, soooo 2012</li>
			<li>Together: group linked together, share, message board</li>
			<li>Improve: learn, make better, eat your own dogfood, ask feedback, TEST</li>
			<li>Beauty: think about design (programms and ...)</li>
		</ul>
		The style guide of material design will be used in combination with some Polymer. Just to test that technics. 
		The data structure of the course must be changed a little. It is/was on day basis but due to time restriction this is not correct anymore. There are certainly parts and different subjects. The different subjects sometimes depend on each other.
